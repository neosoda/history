# History 

> **Discover the stories behind every place on Earth**

An interactive 3D globe that lets you explore the fascinating history of any location on the planet. Born from a love of "doom-scrolling" Google Maps and learning about random islands, untouched places, and interesting geographical areas - History brings deep historical research to your fingertips.

##  What is History?

History is an open-source application that combines:
- **Interactive 3D Globe** - Navigate a beautiful satellite view of Earth powered by Mapbox GL
- **AI-Powered Deep Research** - Click anywhere to get comprehensive historical analysis via the Valyu DeepResearch API
- **Instant Discovery** - Learn about remote islands, ancient cities, geographical wonders, and historical sites

Perfect for:
-  Geography enthusiasts who love exploring maps
-  Discovering the stories behind remote islands and untouched places
-  Learning about historical events tied to specific locations
-  Understanding the geological and cultural significance of geographical areas
-  Satisfying your curiosity about any place on Earth

##  Why I Built This

I love doom-scrolling Google Maps - clicking on random islands in the Pacific, exploring untouched wilderness areas, finding weird geographical features, and wondering about their stories. But finding detailed historical information about these places meant searching through dozens of sources, Wikipedia rabbit holes, and academic papers.

**History solves this.** Click anywhere on the globe, and within seconds, get a comprehensive research report about that location's history, significance, and stories. It's like having a personal historian who knows about every corner of Earth.

##  Database Schema

History uses a minimal database schema optimized for the DeepResearch API:

### `research_tasks`
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to users)
- location_name: text
- location_lat: float
- location_lng: float
- deepresearch_task_id: text (Valyu API task ID)
- status: enum (queued, running, completed, error)
- created_at: timestamp
```

**Note:** Full research content is stored in Valyu's DeepResearch API. We only store metadata and task IDs, keeping the database lean and avoiding duplication.

### `users`
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- email: text
- subscription_tier: enum (free, pay_per_use, unlimited)
- created_at: timestamp
```

### `user_rate_limits`
```sql
- user_id: UUID (primary key)
- query_count: integer
- last_reset: timestamp
```
